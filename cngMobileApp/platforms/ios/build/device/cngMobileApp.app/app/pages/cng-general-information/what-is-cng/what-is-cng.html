        Compressed natural gas, or CNG, is natural gas under pressure which remains clear, odourless, and non-corrosive – and can be used as a cheaper, greener, and more efficient alternative to the traditional petrol and diesel fuels for vehicles.
        
        CNG is comprised mostly of methane gas which, like gasoline, produces engine power when mixed with air and fed into your engine’s combustion chamber. CNG is compressed so that enough fuel can be stored in your vehicle to extend driving range, much like the gasoline tank in vehicles.
        
        Diesel and gasoline vehicles will need to be converted to use CNG fuel.

        A typical passenger car converted to use CNG or an OEM CNG vehicle normally have a capacity of approximately 15 litres gasoline equivalent of CNG, which can take you depending on your driving habits up to 200km. At today’s prices 15 litres of CNG will cost 15 dollars. Its important to note, one litre gasoline equivalent of CNG will take you the same distance as one litre of gasoline.">

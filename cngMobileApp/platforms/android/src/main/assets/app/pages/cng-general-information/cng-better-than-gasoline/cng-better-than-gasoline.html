        CNG is one of the most viable alternatives to traditional liquid fuels for vehicles here in Trinidad and Tobago.
        
        CNG is cheaper – CNG is almost one third the price of super gasoline, resulting in substantial savings in fuel costs.
        
        CNG reduces maintenance cost – CNG contains no additives and burns cleanly leaving no by-products of combustion to contaminate your spark plugs and engine oil. The combustion chamber parts function at peak output for longer periods before requiring service. The engine oil also remains clean which minimises engine wear and requires less frequent changes.
        
        CNG is more environment friendly – CNG engines run more quietly due to the higher octane rating of CNG over gasoline and they produce less exhaust emissions. Harmful emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) can be reduced by as much as 95% when compared to gasoline powered vehicles.
        
        CNG is safer – CNG components are designed and made to international standards and are monitored to ensure safe operation. CNG fuel systems are also sealed, which prevents any spill or evaporation losses.">
